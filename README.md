# rendrr
a simple software renderer for a pet project, and also curiosity for trying out SDL2 and C++

## why? 
i got bored one day and saw a video of someone making a software renderer with among us loaded in it

if you are the one behind it, hello! nice to meet you!

## don't you have like 10 other projects on hand? what about stupid-editor
i forgot why i made that, and i honestly got burned out trying to build macrobar

## this looks kinda cool, can i see?
Naah this looks like crap lmao

made with love and hate; by nth.

<sub> expect this project to have bogus commits, code that does not make sense and overall Bad Practice</sub>
